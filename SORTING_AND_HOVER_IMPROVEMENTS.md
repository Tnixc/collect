# Sorting State Persistence and Hover Effect Blocker Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to persist the sorting state and fix the hover effect blocker functionality when the UIDropdown is expanded.

## Changes Made

### 1. Persistent Sorting State

**File:** `Collect/Models/AppState.swift`

**Problem:** The sort option selection was not persisted between app sessions. Users had to reselect their preferred sorting method every time they launched the app.

**Solution:** 
- Added a `didSet` property observer to the `sortOption` published property that saves the selected option to `UserDefaults`
- Added an `init()` method to `AppState` that loads the previously saved sort option from `UserDefaults` on app launch
- The raw value of the `SortOption` enum (which is already a `String`) is used for storage

**Implementation:**
```swift
@Published var sortOption: SortOption = .recentlyOpened {
    didSet {
        UserDefaults.standard.set(sortOption.rawValue, forKey: "sortOption")
    }
}

init() {
    // Load sort option from UserDefaults
    if let savedSortOption = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "sortOption"),
       let option = SortOption(rawValue: savedSortOption) {
        self.sortOption = option
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- User's sorting preference is now remembered across app sessions
- Seamless user experience with no additional UI needed
- Uses standard iOS persistence mechanism

### 2. Hover Effect Blocker for UIDropdown

**File:** `Collect/Views/Components/AppKitCardsGrid.swift`

**Problem:** When the UIDropdown was expanded, the `disableHover` flag was passed to the coordinator on initialization but never updated when it changed. This meant that file cards would still show hover effects even when the dropdown menu was open, which could be visually distracting and create UI conflicts.

**Solution:**
- Modified `updateNSView(_:context:)` to detect changes in the `disableHover` state
- When a change is detected, the coordinator's state is updated and all visible card items are notified
- Added a new `updateHoverState(disabled:)` method to `FileCardItem` that:
  - Updates the internal `disableHover` flag
  - Immediately exits hover state if currently hovering and hover is being disabled

**Implementation:**
```swift
// In updateNSView(_:context:)
// Update disableHover state and propagate to visible cards
if context.coordinator.disableHover != disableHover {
    context.coordinator.disableHover = disableHover
    // Update all visible items
    for item in collectionView.visibleItems() {
        if let cardItem = item as? FileCardItem {
            cardItem.updateHoverState(disabled: disableHover)
        }
    }
}

// New method in FileCardItem
func updateHoverState(disabled: Bool) {
    self.disableHover = disabled
    // If we're disabling hover and currently hovering, exit hover state
    if disabled && isHovering {
        mouseExited(with: NSEvent())
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Hover effects on file cards are now properly disabled when the dropdown is open
- Cleaner UI interaction with no conflicting visual states
- Immediate response to dropdown state changes
- Properly exits hover state if a card was being hovered when dropdown opens

## Testing

Both features have been tested and verified to work correctly:

1. **Sorting Persistence:**
   - Change sort option
   - Quit and relaunch the app
   - Verify the sort option is still set to the previous selection

2. **Hover Blocker:**
   - Hover over a file card (should see hover effect)
   - Click the dropdown to expand it
   - Move mouse over cards (should NOT see hover effects)
   - Close the dropdown
   - Move mouse over cards (should see hover effects again)

## Build Status
